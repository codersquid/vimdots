vim files

experimenting with vim pathogen and other bundles. works on my macbook air,
with vim compiled from src with +python plus this, that, and the other rather
than the stock vim.

yet to try it out in all of my environments. eventually.

experimenting with using submodules. when cloning this, don't forget to call

git submodule init
git submodule update
